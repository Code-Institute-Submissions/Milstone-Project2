# Milstone-Project2

It is an app on live tracking of recent Covid19 cases worldwide based on Google map along with javascript.
It shows the latest data using live Covid19 cases APIs, it can use by anyone, and based on user search it displays the selected country with covid19 cases e.x: Total cases, Recovered and Deaths in number as well as total update cases for the whole world. Individual country's information can be displayed by click on each country's marker. The site also has a reference link TO the World Health Organisation(WHO) which can provide important information and guidelines during this on-going Covid19 pandemic. However, I have inspired from " https://jeet-khondker.github.io/covid19-live-tracker/".
## UX
Expected users of the website could be any individuals who want know about the covid19 pandemic locally or globally.
